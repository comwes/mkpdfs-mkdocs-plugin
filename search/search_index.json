You just have to run the following command: pip install mkpdfs-mkdocs Configurations You can customise the layout of the generated PDF using exposed options presented in the folliwing table. Option Description author The author of the document. This information will be printed on the cover page of the generated PDF. company If this documentation is from a company, then you should provide this information. It will be displayed on the front page of the documentation, bellow the author information toc_title The table of content title. The default value is Table of Contents toc_position The position of the table of contents. This option supports 3 differents values: pre to put the toc at the beginning of the file but after the cover (* the default value ), post to put it at the end of the file or none to not generate it at all. output_path The file name of the generated PDF, relative to the site_dir . By default this location is set to pdf/combined.pdf design Relative to your MkDocs repository , this option is the location of the CSS file defining the layout of the generated PDF. If this option is not defined the default design will be used. Defining an non existing file will cause the build or serve failure. Configuration example Here is an example of configuration that you can adapt depending on your needs. plugins : - search - mkpdfs : company : The War Company Inc. author : Monsieur Silvestre toc_title : ToC Hide file content from the generated PDF Sometime it can be interesting to hide a given documentation file from the PDF. This can be achieved by using the Mkdocs YAML Style Meta-Data features.

They are completely separated to make it possible for you to customise and to avoid layout issues that we've encoutered while using other PDF generation plugins. With this plugin you can easily customise the design of your PDF by using CSS. Customisation Lets say you mkdoc schema is as following: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 design \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 style.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml You can customise your PDF layout design by passing a CSS file location to the parameter design like in the folowing example. plugins : - search - mkpdfs : design : design/style.css Note Currently the plugin only supports the use of one file. The provided file location, must be relative to your MkDocs project folder. External url display It can sometime be interesting to display hidden external links to the file so users can copy-paste them. For that purpose we have added the class external-links to all external urls and you can add this feature by adding to your css file the following code. . external-link :: after { content : \" (\" attr ( href ) \")\" ; font-style : italic ; } Other CSS identifiers We have also exposed some style, that makes it easier to customise the Table of Contents, the document cover, the document title, the document author, the document company, and the copyright text. On the cover You can use the following css identifiers to modify your cover. #doc-cover : Id of the cover containers. All elements are inside it. #doc-title : The title container. You can use this to modify the apparence of the title present on the cover address : This tag located in #doc-cover contains the author, company and the copyright information when they are available. p.author : It contains the document author in the #doc-cover . p.company : It contains the the document company in the #doc-cover . #copyright : It contains the copyright text. This can be, as an example, added in the footer of each page. Pages Layout You can use the @page css to modify page layout. Please find more information at MDN . Built Layouts Our plan is to provide documentation layouts that can be used directly in your project. These built layouts will be available soon. Meanwhile you can also use the design sample to inspire you. Design sample We have created a design sample to ease this customisation step. You can find it on Github . Usage In order to start using the design, a Node.js version of at least 8 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/comwes/mkpdfs-design-sample Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkpdfs-design-sample npm install Modifications Modify scss files as you need. In the report.scss you can modify two parameters to change the color main colors. - $bgTextColor : The text color when there's a background. - $bgColor : The document title color, background color and the titles colors on pages.
